                <p> Hi! My name is Wren Lowe. I am currently a senior at the University of Maryland - College Park,
                        with the expected graduation date of May 2024. I am persuing a major in Computer 
                        Science with a minor in Technological Entrepreneurship and Corporate Innovation (MTECH). At UMD,
                        I am a member of the Association of Woman in Computing (AWC). AWC is a club which promotes inclusivity 
                        and provides woman and their allies a safe space to connect and advance their computer science skills.
                    
                        Aside from school and work, I enjoy running/working out, reading, spending time with friends and family, and
                        painting. Recently, I have been spending my free time training for a half marathon.

                    <h2>ARLIS Research Assistant</h2>
                    <p> I currently work as an undergrad research assistant at the Applied Laboratory for Intelligence and 
                        Security (ARLIS). In this position, I am currently working on a project utilizing Natural Language 
                        Processing (NLP) techniques, HTML, JavaScript, and React. 

                        This project processes has the user upload data, by its nature this data is often "messy" 
                        (uses a lot of abbreviations and lacks formatting). Then this data is parsed into tokens and 
                        it's meaning is derived, and then displayed as a graphic. This graphic is generated using Plotly, 
                        and then displayed on the website using React.</p>

                    <h2>ARLIS Summer Intern</h2>
                    <p>Over the summer I worked as an intern at the Applied Laboratory for Intelligence and Security 
                         (ARLIS). In this role, I worked on Identifying Characteristic of Disruptive Technology in the 
                         Public Health Sector.

                         This project included conducting initial research on both the intelligence community, current 
                         regulations, and disruptive technologies in their arena. Then, I utilized Natural Language 
                         Processing (NLP) techniques to help expediate and advance the research process, using the 
                         initial information gathered. 

                         I also used NLP techniques to help generate graphics (including plots and word clouds) to help
                         provide visualizations to support our research</p>

                    <p> I am currently a teaching assistant (TA) for discrete structures (CMSC250) at the University of 
                        Maryland - College Park. In this role, I am responsible for teaching two discussion sections twice a week, holding office hours,
                        and grading the students work.</p>
